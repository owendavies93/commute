A simple way to monitor commuting times and other metrics.

If you want to use this (lol), you need:
- Perl (any modern version)
- Mojolicious Lite
- Mojolicious database, YAML and Basic Auth plugins
- MySQL (obviously interchangeable, the SQL is very basic)

All the action happens in commute.pl. There's an example schema, YAML config
in there as well, and some markup and basic Javascript in a template.
